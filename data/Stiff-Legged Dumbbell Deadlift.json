Keep moving forward as if you were going to pick something from the floor until you feel a stretch on the hamstrings.  Exhale as you perform this movement",

        "Caution: This is not an exercise that is recommended for people with lower back problems.  Also, it needs to be treated with the utmost respect paying special attention not to round the back forward as you move the torso down; the back should always be straight.  Finally, jerking motions or doing too much weight can injure your back.",
        "Variations: The exercise can also be performed with a barbell also."
